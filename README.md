# Inspiration
On the fateful day of June 12, 2025, Sabih talked with the Public Works Director of the City of Evans, Colorado. It is a small city with a population of just 20k, and his role was to oversee the roads, water lines, utility poles, etc.

In that call, Mr.Bereskie explained the various problems his department had with the current asset management software they used. When Sabih first asked him about their tech stack, the first words out of the director's mouth was "this is a sore point". He mentioned missing features that they had to creatively work around. He also gave an example of not knowing they ran out of inventory for an item that construction companies needed to get water from fire hydrants for construction sites.

He also mentioned that the smaller companies in this space were getting bought out by larger ones, and then jacking up the prices.

That's when he realized that this space needs some startup love - high quality solutions at an affordable price.

# What's next?
The graveyard of completed hackathon projects probably. This was interesting, but cities are a bit hard to sell to, and convince to switch to something like us.
